Solutions to the assessment 

1. Bug 1: Select dropdown doesn't scroll with rest of the page

-> I fixed this bug by changing the position of the dropdown container from 'fixed' to 'absolute'. This way, it will now 
scroll along with the rest of the page.

2. Bug 2: Approve checkbox not working

-> Fixed this bug as there was a <label> as a separate component which was getting triggered instead of the checkbox. So I 
moved the className to Input component of checkBox. Now it works fine.

3. Bug 3: Cannot select _All Employees_ after selecting an employee

-> Fixed this bug by loading all the employees when selected All employees as it was setting to null handled it with a if condition and
loaded the employees in the App.tsx


4.Clicking on View More button not showing correct data

->  FIxed this bug by appending the new set of data to the old and loading it together and displaying it.


5.Employees filter not available during loading more data
 Part 1:
 -> This bug was a tricky one to understand I had to come up with a plan where once the employees load it is not supposed to load again 
 and for this I setLoading to false after the employees are loaded which provides us the expected result

 Part 2:
 -> The bove solutions helped me fix this bug as well

 6. Bug 6: View more button not working as expected
 Part 1:
 -> Fixed this bug add a conditions display pagination until the next page is not null

 Part 2:
 -> The above solution helped me to fix this bug as well

 7. Bug 7: Approving a transaction won't persist the new value

 -> To fix this bug I had to understand Customfetch or the fakeAPI and by using the fetchWithoutCache I solved this bug.

 Thank you for this opportunity. Looking forward to the possiblity of working together.
